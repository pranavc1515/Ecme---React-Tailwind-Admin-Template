                This guide will walk you through configuring TypeScript settings
                and taking advantage of its features in Elsatr. Since Ecme is
                fully developed in TypeScript, it allows you to write type-safe
                and scalable code, making it easier to build modern web
                applications.

                <h5>Configuring TypeScript Settings</h5>
                <p>
                    Proper configuration is essential in TypeScript projects as
                    it lets you customize various compiler options to suit your
                    project's needs. You can adjust these settings in the{' '}
                    <code>tsconfig.json</code> file.

                <h5>Adjusting TypeScript Strictness</h5>
                <p>
                    We understand that not everyone may be comfortable with
                    TypeScript's strict type checking. If you prefer a more
                    relaxed, JavaScript-like experience, you can adjust the
                    settings to allow for weaker type checking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here's an example of a <code>tsconfig.json</code>{' '}
                    configuration for weak type checking:
                </p>
                <SyntaxHighlighter language="json">{`{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": false,
    ...
  }
}`}</SyntaxHighlighter>
                <p>
                    This setup relaxes TypeScript's strictness, giving you more
                    flexibility and a coding experience closer to JavaScript.
